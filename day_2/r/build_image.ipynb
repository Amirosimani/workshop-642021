    "SageMaker Studio notebooks provide a set of built-in images for popular data science and ML frameworks and compute options to run notebooks. The built-in SageMaker images contain the Amazon SageMaker Python SDK and the latest version of the backend runtime process, also called kernel. With the custom images feature, you can register custom built images and kernels, and make them available to all users sharing a SageMaker Studio domain. You can start by cloning and extending one of the example Docker files provided by SageMaker, or build your own images from scratch.\n",
